Successive test\\nresults for a given patient’s viral load are calculated on a\\nbase 10 logarithmic scale.\\nBETA2-MICROGLOBULIN (/H92522M). Beta2-microglobulin\\nis a protein found on the surface of all human cells with\\na nucleus. It is released into the blood when a cell dies.\\nAlthough rising blood levels of /H92522M are found in\\npatients with cancer and other serious diseases, a rising\\n/H92522M blood level can be used to measure the progression\\nof AIDS.\\nP24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral\\ncore of HIV , p24 is a protein that can be measured by\\nthe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to\\nmeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-\\ntions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful in\\ndetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-\\ner, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of persons\\ninfected with HIV .\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-\\ntions, common in people with HIV , are causing drug\\nresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specific\\ngenetic mutations of within the virus that are known to\\ncause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.\\nFor example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine\\n(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that have\\na mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-\\nscriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V\\n(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-\\ntance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-\\nly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely to\\nrespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are only\\neffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-\\ntion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per\\nmilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually\\nbetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered by\\nmany insurance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-\\ntypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of a\\npatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.\\nTo do this, it measures the concentration of a drug\\nrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. This\\nis the same method used by researchers to determine\\nwhether a drug might be effective against HIV before\\nusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is a\\nmore direct measurement of resistance than genotypic\\ntesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-\\ning does not require a high viral load but it is recom-\\nmended that persons already be taking antiretroviral\\ndrugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now\\ncovered by many insurance plans.\\nAIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire\\nthe infection through the mother’s placenta or during the\\nbirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-\\ning and monitoring of all children born to mothers with\\nHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months\\nis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-\\nfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosed\\nby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24\\nantigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician to\\nidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and\\n95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS\\ndiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take the\\npatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-\\nstances into account and to provide counseling before and\\nafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope with\\nthe results if the doctor has spent some time with them\\nbefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIV\\ninfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type of\\ninformational counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-\\nitive, he or she will need counseling, information, referral\\nfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel the\\npatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-\\nselor to discuss the results of the blood tests with the\\npatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional and\\npsychological status, including the possibility of violent\\nbehavior and the availability of a support network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to any\\nphysical risks connected with blood testing. Some\\npatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-\\nnosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,\\nresources, belief system, and similar factors.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and\\nPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.\\nNormal results for blood cell counts:\\n• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the\\nwhite blood cells.\\n• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 286\\nAIDS tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 86'), Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\medical_book.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='• T cell lymphocytes: 644-2200/mm\\n3\\n, 60-88% of all lym-\\nphocytes.\\n• B cell lymphocytes: 82-392/mm\\n3\\n, 3-20% of all lympho-\\ncytes.\\n• CD4+ lymphocytes: 500-1200/mm\\n3\\n, 34-67% of all\\nlymphocytes.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe following results in AIDS tests indicate progres-\\nsion of the disease:\\n• Percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes: less than 20% of all\\nlymphocytes.\\n• CD4+ lymphocyte count: less than 200 cells/mm\\n3\\n.\\n• Viral load test: Levels more than 5000 copies/mL.\\n•/H9252-2-microglobulin: Levels more than 3.5 mg/dL.\\n• P24 antigen: Measurable amounts in blood serum.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAvrameas, Stratis, and Therese Ternynck. “Enzyme Linked\\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA).” In Encyclopedia of\\nImmunology.V ol. 1.

However, other tests, such as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 87\\nAlanine aminotransferase test\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 87'), Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\medical_book.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='the levels of the MB fraction of creatine kinase should\\nindicate whether the abnormal test levels are because of\\nmuscle or liver damage.\\nDescription\\nThe alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can reveal\\nliver damage. It is probably the most specific test for\\nliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damage\\nis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since the\\namount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higher\\nALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,\\nALT levels may experience serious liver damage without\\nan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may\\nindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT\\nlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,\\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-\\ntant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,\\nwithin a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater\\nfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from\\nalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be\\ngleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from\\na vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep the\\nwound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-\\ndage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report any\\nunusual symptoms to their physician.\\nNormal results\\nNormal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nand should be available to your physician at the time of\\nthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-\\ncates many laboratories find values from approximately\\nseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nLow levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may\\nindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000\\nIU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-\\nins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually\\nresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart\\nattack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L that\\nresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the\\nbile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)\\nmay support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.\\nIt is important to note that persons with normal liv-\\ners may have slightly elevated levels of ALT. This is a\\nnormal finding.\\nMichael V .

Many types of albinism\\nexist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying\\ndegrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may\\nbe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin\\ncancerlater in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five\\npeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.\\nOther parts of the world have a much higher rate; for\\nexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every\\n100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” which\\naffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,\\nhair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People\\nwith a less severe form are born with white hair and\\nskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone\\nwith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal\\nflickering eye movements (nystagmus ) and sensitivity\\nto bright light. There may be other eye problems as\\nwell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes\\n(strabismus).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lack\\ncolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms of\\nocular albinism; some types cause more problems—\\nespecially eye problems—than others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 288\\nAlbinism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88'), Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\medical_book.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nEvery cell in the body contains a matched pair of\\ngenes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act as a\\nsort of “blueprint” that guides the development of a fetus.\\nAlbinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw in\\none or more of the genes that are responsible for direct-\\ning the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment).
